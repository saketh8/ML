# Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning
Here is the problem statement

●	Project Summary

       In this project tries to create a new model based on the data provided is to evaluate the life expectancy in  India.
The data offers a timeframe from 2015 to 2022. The output algorithms have been used to test if they can maintain their accuracy in predicting the life expectancy for data they haven't been trained. Five algorithms have been used:
1.Linear Regression

2.Polynomial Regression

3.Logistic Regression

4.Ridge Regression

5.Lasso Regression

●	Project Requirements

            The scope of this project is to predict the guesstimate given my current knowledge and the limited amount of time I have spent researching and thinking about this question, is that there is a 15% chance that life expectancy will decline in the future. If it does, then my best guess is that the mean value – of the range of possible life expectancies in 2050  is 70 years, which is close to the current value of female life expectancy in the world as a whole. Discussions among a group of experts and systematic consideration of various scenarios would undoubtedly produce values different from 15% and 70 years, but these values illustrate the approach according to the research.
            
●	Functional Requirements
 1. Create a data model present on the database.
 2. The dataset are made available to the public to the purpose of health data  analysis.
3.It is related to the different countries depending on the different countries while finding the dataset in different countries might be difficult and hence we decided that we exclude these countries from the final dataset.

●	Technical Requirements 
1.	The merged dataset by using the databases in the csv formats.
2.	We can use datasets with the help of machine learning and data science with the help of pyhton.
   
●	Software Requirements

        Python IDE, Excel, IBM Cloud, IBM Watson
